# Installation #

Minimum Requirements:
- Android API level: 15+

To start using the SDK, include this in your app *build.gradle*

```java
dependencies {
    compile 'it.near.sdk.core:nearitsdk:2.1.12'
}
```

In the *onCreate* method of your Application class, initialize a *NearItManager* object, passing the API key as a String


```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
  nearItManager = new NearItManager(this, getResources().getString(R.string.nearit_api_key));
  // calling this method on the Application onCreate is MANDATORY
  nearItManager.initLifecycleMethods(this);
}
```

You can find the API key on [NearIT web interface](https://go.nearit.com/), under the "SDK Integration" section.

The constructor for `NearItManager` will try to sync the recipes with our servers. If you need to sync the recipes configuration more often than you call the constructor, call this method:

```java
nearItManager.refreshConfigs();
```

If you need feedback on whether the refresh was successfull or not, you can use this other version of the method:

```java
nearItManager.refreshConfigs(recipeRefreshListener);
```
